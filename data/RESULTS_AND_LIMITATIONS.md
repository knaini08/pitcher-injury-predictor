**Results.** Using Statcast pitch-by-pitch data (2021–2023) with RosterResource injury labels, I built pitcher-season features (velocity, spin, workload, pitch mix) and trained models with a proper temporal split (train: 2021–2022; test: 2023). Baseline logistic regression achieved ROC AUC N/A. Gradient boosting (XGBoost) improved discrimination to ROC AUC 0.665, and with engineered features—velocity deltas, 14-day workload spikes, and breaking-usage change—the best model reached ROC AUC 0.668 (on 2023 holdout). Due to extreme class imbalance, threshold tuning (e.g., Youden’s J / best-F1) is necessary to trade recall vs precision.

**Limitations.** Injury is a rare and partially noisy label; RosterResource coverage varies by year. Labels are season-level (did a pitcher go on IL this season), which ignores injury timing within the year. Feature scope is mostly kinematics/workload; external risk factors (medical history, biomechanics labs, conditioning) are absent. A richer label (injury date) and finer-grained rolling features should improve recall without spiking false positives.
